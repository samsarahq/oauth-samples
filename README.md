# Samsara OAuth 2.0 Samples

This repository contains examples for authenticating to Samsara's APIs using OAuth 2.0 to build marketplace apps. Marketplace apps let you create solutions that many Samsara customers can use. If you're building a custom in-house integration for your organization create an API token instead.

[ðŸ“˜ Samsara OAuth 2.0 Documentation](https://developers.samsara.com/docs/oauth-20)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the OAuth Client ID and OAuth Client Secret for a Samsara app which you can create from the Samsara Dashboard. **Settings** > **OAuth 2.0 Apps** > **Create new app**

We'll use local `.env` files to store the OAuth Client ID and OAuth Client Secret and load them as environment variables. Each example has its own `.env.example` file that you can copy and rename to `.env` and populate with your OAuth Client ID and OAuth Client Secret.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Be sure to store access tokens and refresh tokens securely. These examples store the user's credentials in a local SQLite database for simplicity of the demo..

### Overview

These examples show how you might implement these features of a marketplace app:

| Endpoint | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `GET /` | A landing page that shows an access token if authenticated and a link to `/auth/samsara` to start the authorization flow. |
| `GET /auth/samsara` | Returns a redirect to Samsara's OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. |
| `GET /auth/samsara/callback` | Handles the callback from Samsara's OAuth 2.0 authorization flow and exchanges an authorization code for an access token and refresh token. |
| `GET /auth/samsara/refresh` | Refreshes the access and refresh tokens. |
| `GET /auth/samsara/revoke` | Revokes the refresh and access tokens. |
| `GET /me` | An API call using an access token that returns the current user's Org account information. Note: To access this endpoint your OAuth 2.0 application must have the `Read Org Information` scope under `Setup & Administration` when configuring the app. |

### How to run the examples
